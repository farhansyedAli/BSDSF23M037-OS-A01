### Q1. Explain the linking rule $ (TARGET) : $ (OBJECTS) — how does it differ from linking against a library?

Answer : That rule means the final executable target depends directly on object files; the linker simply combines the object code into the executable. When linking against a library (static or dynamic), the target depends on the library file (e.g., libmyutils.a or -lmyutils) rather than individual object files; the linker either copies needed object code from the archive into the executable (static) or stores a runtime reference to a shared object (dynamic).


### Q2. What is a git tag and difference between simple & annotated tag?

Answer :  A git tag marks a specific commit as a release point. A lightweight (simple) tag is just a name referencing a commit. An annotated tag stores metadata (tagger, date, message) and is a full object in git — recommended for releases because it contains a message and signing capability.


### Q3. Purpose of creating a Release on GitHub & attaching binaries?

Answer :  A GitHub Release provides a human-readable release page and lets you attach compiled assets so users can download binaries (e.g., bin/client) without building from source. It’s how you distribute compiled versions and document what changed in that version.


## Feature-3 Questions/Answers

### Q1. Compare the Makefile from Part 2 and Part 3. What are the key differences in the variables and rules that enable the creation of a static library?

Answer : Part2 compiled all .c files directly into one executable. Variables referenced source files and object files only.

Part3 adds a LIBDIR and rules to build object files for the library modules, then archives them into lib/libmyutils.a using ar rcs. The final link rule links main.o with the archive (either via full .a path or -L -l flags). New rules: $(STATIC_LIB): $(LIB_OBJS) and a static target. This separates compilation (module → .o), archiving ( .o → .a) and final linking (main + .a → executable)

### Q2. What is the purpose of the ar command? Why is ranlib often used immediately after it? 

Answer :  ar creates an archive (.a) — essentially a simple container of object files. ar rcs libmyutils.a obj1.o obj2.o packs the objects.

ranlib (or ar s/ar rcs on GNU) creates or updates the symbol index in the archive. The index speeds up the linker’s lookup of symbols when linking against the archive. On some systems ranlib is required; on others ar rcs already does the indexing.

### Q3. When you run nm on your client_static executable, are the symbols for functions like mystrlen present? What does this tell you about how static linking works? 

Answer : nm on lib/libmyutils.a shows the functions defined in the library (e.g., mystrlen). After linking statically, nm bin/client_static will show the definitions for the functions your program used — because the linker copied the required object code from the archive into the final executable. This demonstrates that static linking embeds library code into the executable (resulting in a larger binary and making the executable independent of external .so files at runtime).


## Feature-4 Questions/Answers

### Q1. What is Position-Independent Code (-fPIC) and why is it a fundamental requirement for creating shared libraries? 

Answer : -fPIC tells the compiler to generate code that can execute correctly regardless of where the OS loads the library in memory. Shared libraries may be mapped at different virtual addresses in different processes; PIC avoids absolute addresses and uses relative addressing so the same library code can be shared and relocated safely. This is required when creating .so so the loader can map it anywhere.

### Q2. Explain the difference in file size between your static and dynamic clients. Why does this difference exist? 

Answer : A static linked binary includes copied object code from the library inside the executable, making it larger. A dynamically linked binary contains only references to the shared object; the code lives in libmyutils.so and is loaded at run time. Hence the dynamic client is smaller and memory can be shared between processes.

### Q3. What is the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable? Why was it necessary to set it for your program to run, and what does this tell you about the responsibilities of the operating system's dynamic loader? 

Answer : LD_LIBRARY_PATH is an environment variable the dynamic loader (ld.so) uses to search additional library directories at run time. Because our custom lib/libmyutils.so is not installed in system library paths, the loader can’t find it. Temporarily exporting LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH tells the loader where to find libmyutils.so so the program runs. This shows that dynamic linking defers resolving to runtime and the OS loader is responsible for locating and mapping shared objects.
